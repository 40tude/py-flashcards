a[:]               # a copy of the whole array
a[start:stop:step] # start through not past stop, by step
a[-1]              # last item in the array
a[-2:]             # last two items in the array
a[:-2]             # everything except the last two items
a[::-1]            # all items in the array, reversed
a[1::-1]           # the first two items, reversed
a[:-3:-1]          # the last two items, reversed
a[-3::-1]          # everything except the last two items, reversed

tableau_1D = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

Question : EDA - STAT101 - What is an example of discrete quantitative data?
Answer  : 

Nb people in a room




Question : EDA - STAT101 - Which measure of central tendency is the most affected by outliers?
Answer  : Mean

<!-- TODO: Add code or picture -->



Question : EDA - STAT101 - What does a Z-score measure?
Answer  : 
 
* the deviation of a value from the mean 
* measured in standard deviation

Let's go back to the formula... 

* If ``Value`` and ``µ`` are speeds
* The difference between ``Value`` and ``µ`` is also in km/h 
* So it is not easy to know if it's significant or not
    * 10 km/h difference when driving at 130 km/h vs 1_000 km/h difference when running at ½ the speed of light
* But the standard deviation is also in km/h
* So, when you divide by the standard deviation there's no unit 
* Now, we know how far we are from the mean "standard deviations wise" (3 standard deviations, 0.2 standard deviation ...). 




Question : STAT101 - Which sampling method should be avoided due to potential bias?
Answer  : 

Convenience Sampling (vs Random Sampling Stratified Sampling  Cluster Sampling)
