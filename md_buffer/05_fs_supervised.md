Question : LOG-REG - What does the ROC curve represent? 
Answer  : The performance of the model in detecting positive observations across all possible thresholds.
Cette courbe montre le compromis entre le True Positive Rate (Recall, TP/(TP+FN), ligne du bas de la matrice de confusion, proportion de vrais positifs détectés par rapport à tous les positifs réels, taux élevé préférable) en ordonnée et le False Positive Rate (FP/(FP+TN, ligne haut de la matrice de confusion, proportion de faux positifs par rapport à tous les négatifs réels, se sont de fausses alarmes, taux bas préférable) en abscisse pour différents seuils de décision. 
Le seuil passe de 1 à 0 quand on va de la gauche vers la droite. 
Seuil = 1 => On classe tout en 0. Pas de vrais positif détecté (TPR=0)          aucun faux négatif (FPR=0) car tout est classé négatif
Seuil = 0 => On classe tout en 1. Tous les vrais positifs sont détectés (TPR=1) mais tous les négatifs réel sont mal classés en 1 (FPR=1)

Comme indicateur global l'AUC est utile pour comparer plusieurs modèles de classification sur un même jeu de données. 
Un AUC de 0.5 indique que le modèle n'est pas meilleur qu'un tirage au sort aléatoire. 
Un AUC de 1.0 indique une séparation parfaite entre les classes 0 et 1.

Answer  : 3 points
1 - L'AUC n'indique pas comment la performance change avec différents seuils. Un modèle peut avoir une AUC élevée, mais cela peut masquer des performances médiocres à des seuils spécifiques
2 - Choix du seuil : La courbe ROC permet de choisir un seuil en fonction des priorités (maximiser TPR, minimiser FPR, etc.). Crucial quand le coût d'une erreur est important (médecine, où les faux négatifs sont plus coûteux que les faux positifs).
3 - Interprétation du modèle : la courbe ROC permet d'identifier les points où le modèle a un comportement instable ou des performances contre-intuitives

Question : BOOST-ADABOOST - Boosting?
Answer  : Surtout en classification mais il existe AdaBoostRegressor() en sklearn. Une méthode d'ensemble qui combine plusieurs modèles faibles pour créer un modèle fort. L'idée est de corriger les erreurs des modèles précédents en se concentrant sur les observations mal classifiées ou mal prédites. ADABoost se concentre particulièrement sur l'ajustement des poids des observations en fonction des erreurs de prédiction.
Étapes principales du Boosting :
	• Initialisation : Commencer avec un modèle faible (par exemple, un arbre de décision simple).
	• Itération : À chaque étape, ajuster les poids des observations en fonction de leurs erreurs, de sorte que les observations mal prédites aient plus d'importance dans le modèle suivant.
	• Combinaison : Les modèles sont combinés selon une pondération basée sur leurs performances pour obtenir le modèle final.
Code AdaBoost:
	base_estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
	adaboost = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=base_estimator, n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1.0, random_state=42)
	adaboost.fit(X_train, y_train)
	y_pred = adaboost.predict(X_test)
