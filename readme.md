TODO :
* Add support for cards based on png images
    * Load the paths to png files in a list
    * insert it into the answer field
    * insert de keyword in the question filed such that we know this is NOT a Q&A but just an illusion... an image
    * in order to display
        * check if it is an image (check the content of the question)
        * if image display it
        * otherwise display Q&A as usual
* Add sample code in 04_fs_big_data.md
* Add CI/CD for automatic testing once testing is working
* Testing 
    * pytest with Flask
    * I don't know how to set it up

* DONE - Fix logger issues such that any function can log properly
    * add and configure a global logger
* DONE - Create an SQL code snippet .md file
* DONE - Create an sns code snippet .md file
* DONE - Create a matplotlib code snippet .md file
* DONE - Add serch engine (see /search route)
* DONE - Display nb of cards in search
* DONE - Display the total number of cards somewhere
* DONE - Add an EDA code snippet .md file

### ATTENTION
* Heroku does not allow "_" in project name
* Use "-" to name your project instead

# Note
* I use WIN11 (while Heroku runs Linux) but most of the information are platform independent
* I use conda

# How to
You should have all the files already. The lines below explain how the project was initially set up.
* conda create --name py-flashcards python=3.12 -y
* conda activate py-flashcards
* create directory py-flashcards 
* cd ./py-flashcards 
* code .
* create file mypy.ini
* create file py-flashcards.py
* conda install flask mypy markdown pygments -y
* create a secrets.ps1 similar to

```
$env:FLASHCARDS_SECRET_KEY = "blablabla"
```
* create .gitignore
    * at least, add a line with : secrets.ps1
* Open a terminal in VSCode (CTRL + Ã¹)
    * ./secrets.ps1
* Strike F5 in VScode
    * The app should be running locally
    * CTRL+C
* conda list -e > ./assets/requirements_conda.txt
* pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
    * At the end of requirements.txt manually add the line "gunicorn==23.0.0"
    * I have to do that because I run WIN11 and I can't install gunicorn
    * gunicorn is only used in "production" on heroku
    * If you run Linux
        * conda install gunicorn -y
        * pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
* create file Procfile
    * Pay attention to :  py-flashcards:create_app()
    * name of the Python file + ":" + entry_point()
    * in py-flashcards.py take a look at create_app()
        * Gunicorn uses the create_app() function to obtain the Flask application instance, and starts the WSGI server
* create file runtime.txt
* From VSCode commit to github
* From the VSCode integrated terminal 
    * heroku login
    * heroku create py-flashcards
        * https://py-flashcards-41b349ab0591.herokuapp.com/ 
        * https://git.heroku.com/py-flashcards.git
        * are created for example
    * git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/py-flashcards.git
    * git push heroku main
    * heroku config:set FLASK_ENV=production
    * heroku config:set FLASHCARDS_SECRET_KEY=blablabla 
    * heroku open
    * This should work

# Workflow
## To run locally
* Open a terminal in VSCode and run ``./secrets.ps1`` once
    * You can type ``ls env:FLASH*`` to double check
* Modify files etc.
* Optional - Commit on github from VSCode    
* Strike F5 while ``py-flashcards.py`` is open
    * If the app complains
        1. Stop the app (CTRL+C)
        1. The Python Debug Console should be opened
        1. Run ``./secrets.ps1`` once in the Python Debug Console

## To deploy on Heroku
* Modify files etc.
* Commit on github from VSCode    
* ``git push heroku main``
* type ``heroku open`` in the terminal (or visit the app web page)

# Q&A
* Q : How to check gunicorn is serving the app on Heroku?
* A : Open a terminal locally
    * heroku logs --tail
    * CTRL+C 
    * CTRL+F gunicorn
    * You should see a line similar to : `[INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0`
